# stmGUI

## Download and Running

The stmGUI application can be run by downloading the project as a .zip, and then navigating to the unzipped directory in RStudio/an R console.

From there, run `shiny::runApp('stmGUIâ€™)` and the application will start in a new window.

Note that the R console will be paused until the Shiny application is shut down.
